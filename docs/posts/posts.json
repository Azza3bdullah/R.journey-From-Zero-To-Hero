    "contents": "\nR.journey From Zero To Hero\n\nThere are very few (if any) fields today that aren‚Äôt impacted in\nsome way, shape or form by programming. Programming is a term that‚Äôs\nbasically synonymous with technology and what professional field today\ndoesn‚Äôt employ some form of technology? The ability to code has become\none of those skills that open up an incredible number of doors if you\npossess it and it‚Äôs this fact that led me to venture into the world of\nR‚Äì one of many programming languages‚Äì to simply explore it and see what\nI could learn. I wanted to write this article not to convince people to\npick up coding as a skill (although it‚Äôs great) but more as a\ndocumentation of my journey in learning a new skill and how important\nhaving an actual purpose for something like this can be, however small\nor niche.\nI officially started this journey just over a year ago and it‚Äôs\nimportant to note that I didn‚Äôt really start it with any specific goal\nin mind nor did I have any real notion of where I could apply this\nskill. In short, I had no purpose. Now, this wasn‚Äôt a problem initially\nbecause I guess you could say my purpose was just to learn the language\nbut even that in itself is incredibly vague and doesn‚Äôt provide a clear\nenough end point.\nIn 2022 I found the best course ‚Äúfrom-Zero-to-hero-in-r‚Äù By Jeelaidm\nThis is a course designed by Batool Almarzouq and delivered in\nJeelAIDM\nWeek1: Introduction to R and RStudio\nWeek2: Introduction to Git/GitHub\nWeek3: First steps in the\ntidyverse\nWeek4: Introduction to ggplot2\nWeek5: Publishing R Markdown and Creating a blog with R\nMarkdown\nLearn How to Join with R Communities (R-Ladies, Open Science\nCommunity Saudi Arabia, R-Ladies Saudi Arabia (Dammam)\n\nIt has been a long journey but it made my summer much more\ninteresting. üíï\nLearned a lot and enjoyed every single minute. üíü Never Stop learning\nwith JeelAIDM\nWe greatful to Dr.¬†Batool Almarzouq, your explaination was wonderful\nthroughout the course‚Ä¶ I really loved it‚ô•Ô∏è\nLooking forward to learn more from you‚Ä¶üíü\nThanks ALL for this wonderful opportunity üôå\n\n\n\n\n",
