# R.journey-From-Zero-To-Hero

# Overview

This is  "Distill Blog" By RStudio.
distill is “Scientific and technical writing, native to the web”. I’ve gotten project of a course "From Zero to hero. R" requests for creating a distill blog from scratch, so I’ve finally gotten around to building that!

Please note that the docs for distill are already Beginner, check them out at: Distill: Creating a Blog. This blog is aimed at the end-to-end process of creating my first blog.

The first blog is typically the hardest and I’ve lived through the uncertainty of not really understanding how all the pieces work together. I appreciate the simplicity of distill for this very reason - there’s less stuff to change. At its core distill is just writing articles for a website/blog!

I also have owed this post to many people, namely Dr. Batool Almarzouq and JeelAIDM Team.
